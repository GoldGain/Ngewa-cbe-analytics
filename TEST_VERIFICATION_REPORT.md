## Known Limitations & Future Work

1. **Timetable Generation**: Backend function created but frontend UI for triggering generation needs to be implemented
2. **After-School Activities**: Infrastructure created but UI for adding activities not yet implemented
3. **Advanced Conflict Resolution**: Current algorithm is basic; advanced scheduling constraints can be added
4. **Performance Optimization**: For large schools with many classes, the timetable generation may need optimization
